This repository contains the code for the algorithm developed as part of the [Swarm Organ Project](http://www.swarm-organ.eu/) and additionally supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness and the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Autonomous and Robotic Systems (FARSCOPE)](http://farscope.bris.ac.uk/). The code is distributed under the MIT license (see the file *LICENSE* for details).



## Description

The following code has been developed specifically for the kilobots [1]. The file *morphogenesis.hex* contains the compiled code of our proposed morphogenesis algorithm, and it is directly available to be uploaded to kilobots. The code was compiled using the [kilolib library](https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib) in its state in June, 2018. For local compilation, please refer to https://www.kilobotics.com/ .

The code has been adapted to the simulator Kilombo [2]. Please refer to https://github.com/JIC-CSB/kilombo to install the simulator and/or understand the syntax.
